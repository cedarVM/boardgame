## Installation (approximately):
Warning: You must have a slightly modified version of [Some Simple Wrappers](https://github.com/xleph/ssw) (ssw) installed system wide for the following:

`(g)cc queue.c boardgammon.c -o boardgammon -lssw`

to compile and link properly.

## Prerequisites:

I never intended for this game to leave my Surface Go + Arzopa setup, but in the case that you wanted to endure a game I suggest using a play 1080x720
